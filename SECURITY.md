### Reporting Process

To report a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

2. **Privately Disclose**: If the vulnerability is sensitive, please privately disclose the details to our security team via email at [security@example.com](mailto:security@example.com). Encrypt sensitive information using our PGP public key available on our website.

3. **Vulnerability Assessment**: Our security team will assess the reported vulnerability promptly and prioritize it based on its severity.

4. **Fix and Release**: Once a fix is developed, we will release a patched version of the project. The timeline for the release will depend on the severity of the vulnerability.

### Expected Response
